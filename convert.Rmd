### {igraph}

In order to be converted into a graph object:

+ nodes need an id, and a name. By default, node name is assumed to be found in the "name" property returned by the graph, specifying any other column is allowed. The "label" column from Neo4J is renamed "group".

+ relationships need a start and an end, *i.e.* startNode and endNode in the Neo4J results. 

```{r}
res %>%
  convert_to("igraph")
```

Which means that you can : 

```{r}
'MATCH p=()-[r:WAS_RECORDED]->() RETURN p LIMIT 5;' %>%
  call_api(con, type = "graph") %>% 
  convert_to("igraph") %>%
  plot()
```
